Hey, thanks for opening up my wad to look around. If you know the places I like
to hang out, feel free to shoot me any questions you may have.

This file sort of acts as a developer commentary. I have two sections, dev
commentary, where I talk about the mod, and character commentary, where I talk
about the gardevoir you play as. I like to talk about my thought process behind
stuff I work on, I feel it's important to share the sort of lessons you learn
through thinking about it yourself, or looking for solutions/inspiration.

The inspiration for the mod came down to a single image: https://twitter.com/marikbentusi/status/1173682164707315712

I found it incredibly hilarious the idea of a psychic not actually using a gun
"correctly", so that's where the mod kicked off. Originally, this was going to
be a plain reskin, but I quickly realized this was a chance to make something 
more engaging. Initially, every weapon was going to do something goofy.

The shotgun would do a sort of "reverse" animation, where instead of pumping the
forend, the forend would stay still and the ENTIRE REST of the gun would move.
This is also where the idea of throwing rockets spawned, it was a goofy idea, so
it went in.

But, as I said, quickly I realized I had to do something more. Coming to terms
with the difficulty of making every other gun do something silly, I thought about
how that if a gun was being psychically held, why not psychically operated as well?
I thought about how someone could psychically operate the slide of a hand gun 
faster than pulling the trigger, and the term I lovingly gave this was 
"Forced Fuller Auto mode". The need to figure out how to balance this inspired
the anger system, and made making the other guns act similar came along.

However, I wranged with a problem still. I still wanted the guns to be silly, and
what could I do to make the chaingun, SSG, and plasma rifle do differently?
I wanted to keep the pistol relevant. As is, unless you're doing a tyson run,
the pistol gets put aside for every gun, so I wanted to keep it relevant. It already
took the slot of "Gun that fires fast", so the chaingun couldn't just get... faster.

Kev is a boy.

I'm only mildly annoyed at the fact that people get this wrong. This isn't my fault,
this isn't their fault, it's Game Freak's, so I'm more mad at them. For those who 
are probably raising their eyebrows at the possibility at aGardevoir being male, 
let's go through their history.

Gardevoir was introduced Gen 3, Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald. Gallade was Introduced
Gen 4, Diamond/Pearl/Platinum. Gardevoir has always been able to be a boy since 
their introduction in Gen 3. Level a Kirlia up to 36 and it will evolve regardless
of gender. So, then it was a retcon in Gen 4? Nope.

Gen 4 introduced a lot of pokemon that evolved from previously "unevolvable" and
ton of "side evolutions" (Think how eevee has several evolutions). Gallade is
one of these. In order to get a Gallade, you must obtain two things. A male
kirlia, and a dawn stone. Then use that dawn stone on the kirlia.

Then, the internet doing what it does best, assumed that masculine pokemon meant
boy, and feminine pokemon meant girl. Is it a big deal? Naw not really, the most
I'll go on about this publicly is probably this text file. BUT, hope you learned
something today. Gardevoir can be boys :)

Now for the more cringe part, haha.

The idea for using a gardevoir, and not just making Doomguy psychic with a hand 
wavy "he's now psychic", or inventing my own character, was the fact that I used
to do the whole pokesona thing. Gardevoir has been my favorite pokemon (long before
I learned how things worked in my pants, don't y'all get the wrong ideas) and did
what any angsty pre-pubescent kid with access to Tumblr and DeviantArt did. Try 
to build an online persona where I was a self insert fan character, doughnut steel!

His outfit was inspired by Scout's Ticket Boy cosmetic from Team Fortress 2. It
was my second cosmetic drop while I was still F2P, which if you know what that means,
you can imagine my excitement for it. I still have it, gave it a stragifier, and
still keep my original load out saved away for nostalgia purposes.

Kev doesn't really have a concrete personality. I'm not a good character writer,
so the best I can offer is imagining how I would respond getting angry. The anger
system with the words describing how angry you are comes from my own sense of
lingo and what sort of words I would use to describe various levels of being
pissed off. I don't like calling myself pissed off per se in anything more formal
than a chat with friends, so it was a pretty good exercise.

Kev has no master/owner. He is a feral gardevoir. He wears clothes so people can 
see he's a boy, and so pervs can't get a good look when they upskirt him. He's not 
afraid to call his dress a dress. Why does he have a gun? WhY iS hE sO aNgErY!?! 
IDK, haven't thought of a reason, and I don't really feel the need to come up 
with one. Modest otherwise, and easily embarassed.

Angry gardevoir are such a mood, though. As much as I like the more cute and delicate
depictions of them, the agressive, violent, and even psychopathic ones are just
so much more interesting and alluring to me. The capacity for world ending violence,
and the glimpses of them being pushed just enough to consciously choose violence.
They're psychic pomemon with insane special attack that can summon black holes.

And this one chose a gun. Sends chills down my spine, and I love the idea.
